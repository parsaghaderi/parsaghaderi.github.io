							I'm currently a first year Master student at Concordia University. 
							My research is mostly focused on Computer Networking, Autonomic Networks, and Topology Discovery.  
							During my Bachelor's I focused on Blockchain and its application for registering information. 
							the subject of Bachelor's thesis was "Registering the intellectual property of Images on blockchain 
							and optimizing or finding the best algorithms for creating a fingerprint of images".  
							Also, I spent the summer of 2019 at Nicosia University, Nicosia, Cyprus. 
							UNIC is still one of the leading universities in the field of blockchain. 
							There I researched on blockchains interoperability and scalability. 
							We tried to demo a blockchain for registering properties and real estates of Cyprus on blockchain. 

							I'm very enthusiastic about learning and sharing my knowledge. 
							So, I decided to become the Teaching assistant of many different courses. 
							during my second year I was the TA for basic and advanced programming course (teaching c and c++) 
							and later I was the TA of basic and advanced topics of Computer Networks (computer networks I and computer Networks II).

							I am constantly trying to develop the great characteristics of a good team leader and a team worker. 
							During work and research I try to create a friendly environment with friends, colleges and co-researchers.
